      Dev Bootcamp is a special place to me and I feel fortunate to have the opportunity to go through even just part of the program. What's amazing about this place is that it doesn't just produce people who can code, it produces people who will be good teammates, problem-solvers, and all around, just good people.

      I'm coming into Phase 0 with a bit of a different awareness of the program, but I can't wait to see it from this angle. Want to know what I've learned about Dev Bootcamp from this video and from my time as a Career Coach here?

      Dev Bootcamp has a culture like none other. It's a place where people care about each other, a place where people build deeper relationships than those of childhood friendships or even those close-knit college relationships. You become a family when you enter the Dev Bootcamp experience. You're embraced with encouragement and support. Everyone wants to see your success.

      I can't imagine learning in a better environment. It's amazing how differently you look at the world after being in a place that is so focused on acceptance, diversity, and growth.

      I thrive in collaborative environments and it seems that from the beginning this was its intent. Dev Bootcamp works when people work together to learn, solve, and experiment. While this is absolutely intimidating to me being that my background is in communications, branding, and people, it's also invigorating knowing that I'll be surrounded by such intelligent people with such diverse back stories.</p>
