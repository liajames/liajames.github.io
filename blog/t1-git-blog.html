  <h1>Git vs. Github</h1>
  <h2>It's more than three letters</h2>
  <h4>Jan. 17, 2015</h4>

    <p>
        Over the last six months I've listened to Dev Bootcamp students talk about Git and Github, in what I thought was interchangeable ways. Oh how wrong I was. For the longest time I thought Git was simply being said shorthand for Github. Kind of like how I thought Java was short for JavaScript. Yeah, no. Clearly I have a lot of learning to do.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the career coach for Dev Bootcamp students in Chicago, I felt I was missing a lot in my support for them. There are just some conversations I can't have... <i>clearly</i>... as you see my misunderstandings in the difference between Git and Github. After embarrasingly admitting some of my ignorance to the students' freshly learned lingo, it was time to commit to partaking in Phase 0 myself.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's what I've learned. Git is software that allows someone to work on a project locally on their computer, saving each version along the way. While Github is a platform remotely where people can share those projects and collaborate with others anywhere they are. Again, Git lives locally on your computer and Github lives remotely on the internet. Makes sense if you think about their names, Github is a <i>hub</i> for Git projects. Easy enough?
    </p>
    <p>
        Easy enough, yes, but clearly there's more to it. There are things that we're learning about (that I hear are pretty important the deeper you get into building) like version control, tracking changes, commit message, and sharing your code. But why are these things important? Here, let me explain.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Version Control</b>
        <br>Version control reminds me a lot of when I first learned how to use a mac in middle school. They weren't quite what they are today and I remember my yearbook teacher telling me "command S after every little thing you do." I learned the hard way a few times. I remember my program would quit and there went all of my work along with it. It sucked, like really sucked to lose everything, but you better believe I learned quickly that saving frequently was my friend.
        <br>
        <br>Similarly, version control gives you a place to fall back on so you don't have to start from scratch if anything is lost or incredibly large mistakes are made. Version control allows you to revert back to a clean working version of your code without scrapping it all.
        <br>
        <br><b>Tracking Changes</b>
        <br>Tracking changes is the checkpoint to where you can return. These files that are considered tracked were in the last snapshot regardless if they're modified, unmodified, or staged. So your work is being tracked along the way making it easy to understand what you've edited since your last commit. I found this cool image that explains it pretty well:
        <br>
        <div align="center"><img src="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/book/02-git-basics/images/lifecycle.png" alt="Tracking Changes" width="550" height="350"></div>
        <br>
        <br><b>Commit Messages</b>
        <br>This is where you can really help yourself in understanding what you've done at each step. Commit messages are important, <i>really important</i>.
        <br>
        <br>You see, I've learned how important it is to commit often so you have recent checkpoints to fall back on and you don't lose a lot of work if any kind of mistake were made. Commit messages are where you explain what you did before saving an edit. I guess this goes back to my "command s" example, except the difference here is that I'll know what I did the last time I "saved" my place.
        <br>
        <br>Gosh, there are so many analogies I want to use here, but I'll spare you... for now.
        <br>
        <br><b>Sharing Your Code</b>
        <br> So you've saved, and saved, and saved some more... you've really accomplished something beautiful, I'm sure! But you know what's more beautiful, sharing. Sharing your code on Github helps grow the opportunities to learn as a dev. Contributing to open source is part of that as well. Giving back to the tech community is such a big piece of learning it. I've watched Dev Bootcamp grads grow exponentialy when they're actively working on open source projects and practicing their skills.
        <br>
        <br>This is why I've learned it's so important to share your code on Github and contribute to the tech community. Share your code.
    </p>

      In just one week I've learned a lot...and I'm excited to improve my ability to better support the students as they graduate. It may just be a basic knowledge and not even half of what they'll learn throughout the entire program, but I can't wait to see what more I'll get to learn. Here's to eight more weeks... and hopefully many more of learning great new things.</p>
