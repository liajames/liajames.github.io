        <p><strong>Pair programming</strong> is done to complete an objective between two people
        that allows for collaborative learning from each other's practices.</p>

        <p>Pair programming also prepares us for being developers in the real world, as pairing is a <strong>common
        practice</strong> to complete tasks. It is also a great way to learn from each other.</p>

        <p>The <strong>navigator</strong> acts as the guide in a coding challenge to help <strong>the driver</strong> complete a task. The driver
          is in control of the keyboard and is moving through the task.</p>
